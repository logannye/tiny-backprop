# Benchmark Results

This directory stores JSON outputs generated by the benchmark and experiment
scripts. Use the provided Makefile targets to populate baseline measurements:

```bash
make bench-transformer   # writes results/transformer.json
make bench-resnet        # writes results/resnet.json
make bench-gpt2          # writes results/gpt2.json
make bench-long-context  # writes results/long_context.json
make bench-unet          # writes results/unet.json
```

Each file contains raw `BenchmarkResult` entries for the modes selected (naive,
checkpoint, tiny). Summaries can be rendered with:

```python
from benchmarks.utils import summarize, format_summary_table
import json

with open("results/transformer.json") as fh:
    data = json.load(fh)
table = format_summary_table(summarize([BenchmarkResult(**item) for item in data]))
print(table)
```

> ⚠️ Baseline numbers are hardware-dependent. Re-run the commands on your target
> machine to regenerate up-to-date metrics.
